tl;dr

the future is multiprotocol readers with 6c, TDM, and sego

antenna and reader are 2 different pieces of hardware; antenna is possible to determine on google maps, reader is not
wsdot has readers in 5 different places. installed at different times, uses different readers at different places, UNLIKELY that they have replaced any hardware
wsdot uses transcore aa3152 antennas, and has as long as google maps has been recording
washington has both sirit 5204 and trancore encompass 6 readers, and 6c and sego tags

sirit 5204 seems to have always supported 6c and sego
seems like transcore encompass only started supporting 6c sometime between 2019 and 2021
